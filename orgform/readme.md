This directory contains a mirror of a large number of fractal formulas originally written for FRACTINT,
by a large number of different authors. These were collected first by George Martin and later by 
Paul N. Lee. and distributed via a file called ORGFORM.ZIP at from Paul's website www.nahee.com.
Unfortunately Paul has passed on and that site is no longer available. 

The files here were retrieved from the Internet Archive via 
https://web.archive.org/web/20160807081118/http://www.nahee.com/Fractals/ORGFORM.ZIP

The copyright conditions under which these were initially distributed are not clear to me. If anyone
believes they have copyright over any of the files in this collection and would prefer not to have them
distributed, please notify edwin@bathysphere.org.
