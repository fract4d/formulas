                         INFORMATION RE ORGFORM.ZIP
                               (Version 3.3)
                              October 10, 1999

(Some formulas in this compilation require Fractint v. 20.0 to run) 

ORGFORM.ZIP includes the following:

        ORGFORM.DOC - this document
        
        ORGFORM.EXE - a program to build and maintain an organized Fractint 
                      formula directory
        
        _*.FRM      - various files containing Fractint formulas, created
                      from the files on my hard drive as of October 9, 1999. 
                      These include virtually all formulas uploaded to the
                      Digital Art Forum of CompuServe through that date, and 
                      in messages to Fractint and fractal art message sites 
                      now active on the internet.

        Fractint is a freeware fractal generating program ((C) The Stone 
Soup Group) available from Library 9 of the Digital Art Forum of CompuServe 
as FRAINT.EXE, and at Noel Giffin's fractal database website at 
http://spanky.triumf.ca. If you are not familiar with Fractint, you should 
download the program and prepare to have your life become a shambles. 
ORGFORM is a utility to deal with certain DOS text files used by Fractint. 
These files have an extension ".frm" and contain formulas which Fractint 
can use to generate fractal images. Tutorials explaining the basics of
writing your own formulas are included in Fractint's distribution
package.

        Those who create formulas are not lacking in energy. Some users have
created hundreds of formulas, and more are posted regularly. These postings 
are essentially unregulated, which is only proper, but, as a result, the 
accumulated postings contain many copies because formulas are reposted 
for various reasons. In addition, and more worrisome, is the fact that 
there is no standardized naming convention for formulas, and there are 
some instances where a formula name has been used again for a completely 
different formula.

        My goal has been twofold: first, develop a set a formula files 
containing unique formula entries only; and, second, organize the files so 
that different formulas with the same name are readily identifiable. 
The result is ORGFORM (ORGanize FORMulas).

        Beginning in the summer of 1996 I stopped adding new duplicate 
named formulas to the compilation. Formula writers who want to have their
formulas included in the compilation should take care to give their formulas
unique names.

ORGFORM.EXE v. 3.3
==================

     REVISION HISTORY

       v. 3.3

        Added recognition of ismand as a predefined token 
           to conform to a change in Fractint 20.0.
       
       v. 3.2

        Added recognition of if, else, elseif, and endif as
           predefined tokens to conform to changes in Fractint 19.6.

        .par files can now be used as input files; Orgform will extract
           only the formula entries (i.e. those with the label frm:) 
           for inclusion in the compilation.

       v. 3.1

        Added recognition of whitesq, scrnpix, scrnmax, and maxit as
           predefined variables, and use of '\' character to wrap
           long lines of formulas, to conform to changes in Fractint 19.5.

        Elapsed time of Orgform run is shown at the conclusion of the 
           session.

        All formulas have been reformatted for more uniform appearance and
           easier reading in <z> and F2 screens.

       v. 3.0

        Revised entry finding code to conform to Fractint's source code.
           Orgform now runs almost twice as fast as in the past and is
           pretty much assured of extracting the same entries from a file
           as would be found by Fractint v. 19.4.

        Like Fractint, only the first 18 characters of a formula name are
           recognized.

        Added predefined constants floor, ceil, round, and trunc to conform
           to Fractint v. 19.4 enhancements.
       
       v. 2.1

        Improved algorithm for comparing formulas for identity - 
           formulas which are the same but for the variable names
           used are now recognized as the same formula.

        Fixed a bug which caused stray characters to appear in certain
           circumstances in the headings to orgform.log and orgform.sum

        Made revisions to some formulas to improve compatibility with
           Fractint v. 19.3. These formulas should work the same as the
           original versions under Fractint 19.2 and prior. A comment is
           included in each formula which was changed, so that revision
           history can be seen.

        Improved error checking and memory management features.



       v. 2.0
        
        Improved sorting algorithm is faster and more stable.

        Separate files for Bob Carr's formulas, to keep _c.frm from
           becoming unmanageably large. Formulas beginning with 
           "carr" are stored in files beginning "_rc". 

        Switches /h, /h+, /h-, /s, /r, and /a added (See below). 
        
        Files which would be orgform files except that a ! is
           the first character instead of an underscore, can be used
           as input files, and the "source" line will not be added to
           a formula copied to the orgform files. This permits the
           combining of orgform files without accumulating unnecessary
           source references.


        ORGFORM is (c) George G. Martin, 1996 - 1999. The program is 
freeware. The program may be distributed for private use without notice to 
the author. However, no commercial use of the program may be made unless the 
author's consent has been obtained. EMail me at ggmartin@compuserve.com. 
Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. 

     No representation or warranty of any kind is made with respect to
this program. 

   INPUT: Command line syntax is 
   
        ORGFORM [path\inputfiles... ] [/switch...]

     Any number of arguments can be used, and standard DOS filename 
wildcards are permitted.

        EXAMPLE: ORGFORM  *.frm  c:\temp\a*.frm /h+ /s
    
will take all formula files in the current directory and all formula 
files beginning with "a" in the temp directory as input. HOWEVER: no matter 
what arguments are used, the program will not open any input file  
which does not have an extension ".frm" or ".par", and also any file whose 
name begins with an underscore (e.g. a.doc and _a.frm would not be opened, 
even if the command line argument were *.*). The meaning of the switches is  
described below.

     Input files are opened only for purposes of reading them; they are
not changed by ORGFORM.

     OUTPUT: The program reads each formula entry from the input files, and
copies it to a file with the name _?.frm, depending on the first letter of 
the formula (e.g. a formula named George would be copied to _g.frm); if the
output file does not exist, it will be created. Formulas beginning with 
numbers are added to _num.frm, and with non-alpha characters to _chr.frm.
If the output file exists, the formula will be added to the file; existing 
entries will not be affected. If a formula with the same name is present in 
the output file, the program checks to see if the symmetry and formula math 
are the same - if they are, the formula is not added to the file, thus 
avoiding the accumulation of identical entries. If the symmetry or math is 
not the same, the formula is added to a file with the name _?_dup.frm 
(e.g. if a formula George was found but had different math, the new George 
would be added to _g_dup.frm). When a formula is added to a file, a comment 
is inserted in the formula entry showing the name of the source file. 

     Because of the prolific output of Bob Carr, formulas beginning with
the letters "carr" are added to files named _rc*.frm. The "_rc" files are 
named based on the fifth character of a formula beginning with the name 
"carr". If the character is a number, the formula is added a file _rc#.frm 
(e.g., carr1677 is in _rc1.frm). Otherwise, the formula is added to _rc.frm. 

     In addition to the standard orgform files, _extra.frm is also treated
as an orgform file, and will be sorted at the end of an orgform run. Any  
text between entries is lost in this process.

     The comments and text in an input file appearing between formula 
entries are ignored by the program - only the formula entries themselves 
(including the comments contained within the entries) are written to the 
output file.

        All output files are written to the current directory. 

        After the processing of the formulas is completed, the program
rewrites each output file to put the formula entries into alphabetical order.
In effect, the output files are a multi-volume encyclopedia of the formulas 
which you have. 

===============================
MAINTAINING A FORMULA DIRECTORY
===============================

     Most frequent users of FRACTINT have a separate directory on their
hard drives for formula files. Fractint v. 20 provides for the use of
a separate directory for Orgform formula files, which will shorten the
amount of time which the program takes to locate a particular formula.
By way of example, my fractint.exe is at c:\fract20, formulas which I have
not yet processed into the Orgform files are at c:\fract20\formulas, and
the Orgform files are at c:\fract20\formulas\orgfiles. FRACTINT knows
where to find the formulas because of a file "sstools.ini", located in the
DOS path (mine is in the windows directory), which identifies where the
formulas are to be found. See the Fractint documentation for a description
of the creation, format and use of the sstools.ini file.

     When I download a new formula file, I add it to the formula directory, 
and when I'm ready to add it to the Orgform collection I copy it to the
orgfiles directory and run ORGFORM. I then move the new file to a floppy 
disk. This results in one complete set of unique formulas on my hard drive, 
and the numerous source files backed up on floppy disks.

========
SWITCHES
========

     /h, /h+, and /h- (History switches). Use of one of these switches
will cause a file "orgform.log" to be created, and the disposition of
each formula in a run of ORGFORM will be recorded. If the file already 
exists, the information will be appended, and previous information will
not be erased. /h lists every formula looked at. /h+ lists only those 
formulas which were looked at and added to an orgform file. /h- lists only
those formulas which were looked at and skipped. 


/s (Summary switch). This switch causes a file "orgform.sum" to be
created. The file lists the number of formulas in each orgform file. The 
switch can be used in connection with a regular run of ORGFORM, or alone 
(i.e. orgform /s). If the file already exists, information will be appended.

     /r (Reconstruct switch). This switch causes a file "reconstr.frm" to 
be created. One additional command line argument, in the form "*.frm" or
"*.par" is required when this switch is used. The program searches all 
orgform files and copies to reconstr.frm those formulas whose source is the 
one specified in the command line argument. Note that reconstr.frm will not 
be the same as the original source file. First, all "inter formula" text is
gone. Also, formulas which were not copied to an orgform file because they 
were identical to existing formulas will be missing from reconstr.frm.

     /a (Alphabatize all orgform files). Normally, ORGFORM only alphabatizes
orgform files which have been changed by the current run of ORGFORM. This
switch causes all orgform files to be alphabatized. This will be helpful
if you have changed an orgform file with a text editor. The switch can be
used in connection with a regular run of ORGFORM, or alone.


=================================         
FORMULAS INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE
=================================

     Here is a list of the formula files from which the orgform files were 
derived. They were obtained primarily from postings to the Digital Art forum 
on CompuServe. Several are from Noel Giffin's fractal internet site at
http://spanky.triumf.ca. I have also included formulas posted in messages
on the CompuServe forum, to Jon Noring's Fractal-Art message list, and to
Tim Wegner's Fractint message list; formulas found on Fractint users' WEB 
pages, and many formulas sent directly to me by formula writers for 
inclusion in the compilation (a practice which I encourage and am happy 
to accommodate).
