    Most of these images were created with FRACTINT 19 or 19.2. I don't know 
what you'll get with an earlier version of Fractint.

    Don't remove the 'periodicity=0' parameters in the .PAR file.

TO USE THESE FILES:

    First, find the location(s) your other *.PAR and *.FRM files. Put these
new files there.

    Now start up Fractint. Hit the '@' key, then hit 'F6' to see a list of
available PAR files. Choose GALLET. Now just choose the image you want
to see from the displayed list.

   You can play with the formulas too. Hit 'T' for the fractal types menu.
Choose FORMULA. Now hit 'F6' and select GALLET from the displayed list.
Then you can pick the formula you want to play with.
